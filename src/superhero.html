    <p>A <strong>superhero</strong> (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of heroic stock character who possesses supernatural
        or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting <em>the</em> public, and usually battling supervillains.
        A female <strong>superhero</strong> is sometimes called a <strong>superhero</strong>ine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine), although <em>the</em>
        word <strong>superhero</strong> is commonly used for females also. <strong>superhero</strong> fiction is <em>the</em> genre of fiction that is centered on such
        characters, especially in American comic books since <em>the</em> 1930s.
    </p>
    <p>By most definitions, characters do not require actual superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed <strong>superhero</strong>es.[1][2][3]
        While <em>the</em> Dictionary.com definition of "<strong>superhero</strong>" is "a figure, especially in a
    comic strip or cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",[4] <em>the</em>    longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary gives <em>the</em> definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman
    powers; also: an exceptionally skillful or successful person".[5] Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers
    or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as <em>the</em> Spirit, who may not be explicitly
    referred to as <strong>superhero</strong>es but never<em>the</em>less share similar traits.
    </p>
    <p>Some <strong>superhero</strong>es use <em>the</em>ir powers to counter daily crime while also combating threats against
        humanity from supervillains, who are <em>the</em>ir criminal counterparts. Often at least one of <em>the</em>se supervillains
        will be <em>the</em> <strong>superhero</strong>'s archenemy. Some long-running <strong>superhero</strong>es such
        as Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, <em>the</em> Flash, Wolverine, Green Lantern,
        and Hulk have a rogues gallery of many villains.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3 id="section-a">Early history</h3>
    <p><em>the</em> word '<strong>superhero</strong>' dates to at least 1917.[6] Antecedents of <em>the</em> archetype include
        such folkloric heroes as Robin Hood, who adventured in distinctive clothing.[7] <em>the</em> 1903 play <em>the</em>        Scarlet Pimpernel and its spinoffs popularized <em>the</em> idea of a masked avenger and <em>the</em> <strong>superhero</strong>        trope of a secret identity.[7] Shortly afterward, masked and costumed pulp fiction characters such as Zorro (1919),
        <em>the</em> Shadow (1930) and comic strip heroes, such as <em>the</em> Phantom (1936) began appearing, as did non-costumed
        characters with super strength, including Patoruzú (1928), <em>the</em> comic-strip character Popeye (1929) and novelist
        Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner (1930).[8]
    </p>
    <p>In <em>the</em> 1930s, both trends came toge<em>the</em>r in some of <em>the</em> earliest superpowered costumed heroes
        such as Japan's Ōgon Bat[9][10] (visualized in painted panels used by kamishibai oral storytellers in Japan since
        1931), Mandrake <em>the</em> Magician[11][12][13] (1934), Superman in 1938 and Captain Marvel (1939) at <em>the</em>        beginning of <em>the</em> Golden Age of Comic Books.
    </p>

    <h3>1940s</h3>
    <p>During <em>the</em> 1940s <em>the</em>re were many <strong>superhero</strong>es: <em>the</em> Flash, Green Lantern and
        Blue Beetle debuted in this era. This era saw <em>the</em> debut of first known female <strong>superhero</strong>,
        writer-artist Fletcher Hanks's character Fantomah, an ageless ancient Egyptian woman in <em>the</em> modern day who
        could transform into a skull-faced creature with superpowers to fight evil; she debuted in Fiction House's Jungle
        Comics #2 (Feb. 1940), credited to <em>the</em> pseudonymous "Barclay Flagg".[14][15]
        <em>the</em> Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character who fought crime and wartime saboteurs using <em>the</em>        superpower of invisibility created by Russell Stamm, would debut in <em>the</em> eponymous syndicated newspaper comic
        strip a few months later on June 3, 1940.<sup>[16]</sup>

    <h2>Common traits</h2>
    <p>Many <strong>superhero</strong> characters display <em>the</em> following traits:
        <br>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>
                Extraordinary powers or abilities. <strong>superhero</strong> powers vary widely; superhuman strength, <em>the</em>                ability to fly, enhanced senses, and <em>the</em> projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters
                like Batman, Mockingbird, <em>the</em> Phantom and <em>the</em> Question possess no superhuman powers but
                have mastered skills such as martial arts, espionage techniques, and applied or forensic sciences to a highly
                remarkable degree. O<em>the</em>rs rely on fantastical weapons or technology, such as Iron Man's powered
                armor suits, Green Lantern’s power ring, and trick arrows employed by Green Arrow and Hawkeye. Many characters
                supplement <em>the</em>ir innate superhuman powers with a special weapon or device (e.g. Captain America's
                shield, Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Thor's wea<em>the</em>r manipulating hammer, and Wolverine's
                adamantium claws).
            </li>
            <li>
                A strong moral code, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in <em>the</em> service of good without
                expectation of reward. Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal
                weapons.
            </li>
            <li>
                A motivation, such as a sense of responsibility and guilt (e.g. Spider-Man), an altruistic calling (e.g. Wonder Woman), a
                childhood trauma or personal vendetta against criminals (e.g. Batman), or a strong belief in justice and
                humanitarian service (e.g. Superman).
